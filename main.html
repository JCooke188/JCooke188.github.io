		<h1> About Me</h1>
		<p> I am a doctoral Candidate at the University of Pennsylvania in the <a href="https://www.me.upenn.edu/">Mechanical 
		Engineering and Applied Mechanics Department.</a> My research focus is in computational fluid dynamics, and my advisor is 
		<a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=244">Dr. George Park.</a> 
		<br> <br>
		I completed my BS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh in 2018 and conducted research under 
		<a href="https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/HessamBabaee/">Dr. Hessam Babaee.</a>, whom I owe a great deal to for 
		introducing me to the world of CFD, and encouraging me to pursue a graduate education.  
		<br> <br>
		I grew up just outside Boston, MA, and am an avid Boston sports fan.  While growing up I enjoyed playing hockey, football, and baseball, and I still enjoy watching 
		them today. In my free time, I like to go to the gym, cook and go out to eat at new places, play video games with friends, and read/listen to audiobooks. When I can, 
		I also love to travel, and have been lucky enough to visit Cape Town, South Africa, among many other places across the United States.
