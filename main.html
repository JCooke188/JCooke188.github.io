		<h1> Justin Cooke </h1>
		<p> I am a first year Mechanical Engineering PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, with a research
		focus in computational fluid dynamics.  While at Penn, I will be under the guidance of 
		my advisor, <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=244">George Park.</a>
		  I completed my BS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh in 2018 and conducted 
		research under <a href="https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/HessamBabaee/">Hessam Babaee.</a>

		I am originally from right outside Boston, MA, and am an avid Boston sports fan.  I enjoy 
		powerlifting, cooking, playing video games, and reading.  I also enjoy playing
		hockey and golfing.  </p>
