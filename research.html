				<h2> Research Interests <hr> </h2>
				<p> My primary area of research interests are within computational fluid dynamics.  Specifically, I am would like to 
				employ high performance computing (HPC) and numerical solvers to study aerodynamic and hydrodynamic flows.  At present, my 
				focus has been on low Reynolds number flows, but I would like to eventually work in turbulent rough-wall flows.  Other areas of 
				interest include employing data driven modeling techniques in the study and understanding of the physics behind non-equilibrium 
				turbulent flows.  </p>

					<h3> Low Reynolds Number Aerodynamics </h3>
				<p> I am currently conducting research on low Reynolds number flows for micro aerial
					vehicle flight (MAV). My involvement with the design team is to aid in the design and development of 
					propellers for MAVs, using a finite volume flow solver, charles from Cascade Technologies, to analyze 
					aerodynamic forces. Propeller design iterations with various geometric specifications are investigated 
					to determine which characteristics are most favorable for MAV deployment. The present work is looking 
					towards the flight capabilities of insects and other animals that live in the low Reynolds number regime.  
					Much work has been done to review the underlying flow mechanics through an extensive literature review, in order
					to provide inspiration for the propeller geometry. Findings for this work are currently being prepared 
					in an academic paper, which will be submitted to an academic journal soon.  </p>

					<h3> Correlation Between Reynols Number and Rayleigh Number for Vertical Ellipse </h3>
						<div id="video-wrap"> 
							<video id="vertEllipse" src="./VertEllipseNCRa100.mp4" width="480" height="270" controls loop></video>
						</div>
					<p> Worked in a team investigating the possibility of a correlation
					between Reynolds Number, Re, and Rayleigh Number, Ra, for a vertical ellipse. It is known that
					an existing correlation exists for a cylinder, so investigation into similar geometries was conducted.
					I ran high fidelity simulations, accessing remotely high performance computers through a Linux
					based software. Data was extracted from the simulations and then used to visualize these high
					fidelity simulations, and create a relationship between Re and Ra. Findings were presented to the
					rest of the team. <br> <br> The video on the left is a vertical ellipse that in natural convection, with a Rayleigh number 
					of 100. Plumes can be seen once the ellipse has had heat applied to it, and then within a few moments the plumes reduce 
					in size and the system reaches a steady state. The geometry and mesh were made using Nektar++, and the visual was created using EnSign. </p>
