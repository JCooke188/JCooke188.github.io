				<h2> Research Interests <hr> </h2>
				<p> My primary research interests include computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer. Specifically, I am interested in 
				the use of high performance computing, and the creation of novel computational methods to solve these problems. </p>

				<h2> Current Projects <hr> </h2>
					<h3> Low Reynolds Number Aerodynamics </h3>
				<p> Researching low Reynolds number aerodynamics for micro-aerial vehicls (MAVs).  Utilizing a LES based numerical solver, 
					propeller simulations are conducted in order to provide critical to design information on aerodynamic performance 
					based on geometric features.  </p>

					<h3> Correlation Between Reynols Number and Rayleigh Number for Vertical Ellipse </h3>
						<div id="video-wrap"> 
							<video id="vertEllipse" src="./VertEllipseNCRa100.mp4" width="480" height="270" controls loop></video>
						</div>
					<p> Worked in a team investigating the possibility of a correlation
					between Reynolds Number, Re, and Rayleigh Number, Ra, for a vertical ellipse. It is known that
					an existing correlation exists for a cylinder, so investigation into similar geometries was conducted.
					I ran high fidelity simulations, accessing remotely high performance computers through a Linux
					based software. Data was extracted from the simulations and then used to visualize these high
					fidelity simulations, and create a relationship between Re and Ra. Findings were presented to the
					rest of the team. <br> <br> The video on the left is a vertical ellipse that in natural convection, with a Rayleigh number 
					of 100. Plumes can be seen once the ellipse has had heat applied to it, and then within a few moments the plumes reduce 
					in size and the system reaches a steady state. The geometry and mesh were made using Nektar++, and the visual was created using EnSign. </p>

				<h3> Geometric Optimization of a Heat Sink </h3>
				<p> Worked in a team to conduct a proof of concept study on multi-fidelity
				modeling in design optimization. I worked with another student and created a simplified low
				fidelity model for a heat sink, idealizing the geometry into a thermal resistance network. An
				objective function was created such that it could be used for high volume, quick data points. </p>
